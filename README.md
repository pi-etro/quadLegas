## Installation

quadLegas uses Python 3 and the following Python libraries:
* [colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama)
* [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/)
* os (Python Standard Library)
* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
* sys (Python Standard Library)

### Linux
#### Standalone
Currently there is a standalone executable that should work for linux users, you can download it [here](https://github.com/pi-etro/quadLegas/releases/latest/download/quadlegas). Give permission to read and execute with:
```bash
chmod +rx quadlegas
```
And run with:
```bash
./quadlegas
```

#### Source code
If you don't want the standalone version, install the libraries [mentioned](#Installation). You can install them with pip3:
```bash
pip3 install colorama cryptography pandas
```
Download the source code [here](https://github.com/pi-etro/quadLegas/archive/v1.1.zip) and extract it. In the extrated folder use:
```bash
chmod +rx quadlegas.py
```
And run with:
```bash
./quadlegas.py
```

### Others
I haven't tested quadLegas on other OS, but if you manage to install the Python libraries [mentioned](#Installation) you should be able to run it.

## Usage

After you started quadLegas, select option `1` to list all students who are in the same classes as you, enter your university ID (RA) and the path to the *csv* file (`/path/to/file.csv`). Select option `2` to list all students from one or more classes, enter the number of classes to consult, the code for each class and the path to the *csv* file.

In the output *csv* file, each column corresponds to a class with the class code as header, each row has the students' name or the university ID (RA), in case quadLegas doesn't know the name for that ID.

Enter `0` any time to return to the menu and `4` to exit the menu and quit quadLegas.
